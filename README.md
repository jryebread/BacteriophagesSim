In this project so far, I have been focusing how to do collision detection optimally since eventually I'd like to have a large number of bacteria and viruses interacting at once. For this reason, I've started with having the "bad bacteria" in red, consuming the good bacteria in green, and growing as a result.

Each grid localizes the space a bad bacteria object has to look for other good bacteria within. I'm going to play around with the sizes of these localized collision detection spaces for optimallity and proceed to the actual bacteriophage part when I get a chance. It is my last quarter at UCSD so I'm trying to go out with a bang by really going deep into my studies, especially my AI/Security classes I am taking!
